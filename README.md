# JS Weather Forecast
Create a website that uses a free weather API to show forecasts.

This tutorial will show you how to build JavaScript weather forecast website. We use a free API from OpenWeather and build out our own custom jQuery function that gives either yourself or your script users a way to customize the JS without touching the new script.

Follow along and create a great addition to any visitor-based website. I have had to build forecasts and current weather for a lot of sites so it is something useful to have in your toolkit.
